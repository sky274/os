1.
Paging eliminates external fragmentation, but not internal fragmentation. With fixed sized pages we always can allocate a page as long as they are available, it is not dependent on the size of our application. If our application is bigger than a page then we just request more pages. It does not eliminate internal fragmentation because a program may only use a piece of a page and yet all that page memory is allocated to it.

2.
When a process gets a page fault, a local page replacement algorithm selects for replacement some page that belongs to that same process. A global replacement algorithm is free to select any page in memory.
Disadvantage of Local page replacement: Only have access to pages that are within your process. May have to swap out too often
Disadvantage of Global page replacement: Compete for resources to the point of deadlock

1.
(a) In a buddy system, up to 50% of the space can be wasted due to internal
	fragmentation.
2.

(d) Using the first-fit algorithm on a free list that is ordered according to
	increasing block sizes is equivalent to using the best-fit algorithm.

3. Mark & sweep garbage collectors are called conservative if:

(b) They treat everything that looks like a pointer as a pointer.


Answer: a, d, b

5.to avoid fragmentation and overflow.
