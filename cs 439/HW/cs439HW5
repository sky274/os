	Virtual Address (VA) is the address used by CPU. It represents the location of
the data in virtual space (in disk), which is divided into
multiple equal-sized pages. 

Physical Address represents the location of data in main memory. It
represents offset of the referenced physical page.

Translation between physical address and virtual address is supported by
TLB which contains a page table which has the mapping of VA to PA.

	easier shared memory between processes
	eliminates external fragmentation

	resident bit: It specifies if the page currently resides in memory
	clock bit: If the page has been recently used
	dirty bit: If the page has been modified and must be written to disk.
4.
	Paging is vulnerable to internal fragmentation. Each page is the exact size of a frame in physical memory. No memory would be wasted. But internal fragmentation when a process doesnâ€™t use all of the memory of a single page.  
5.
	accessing a page that is not in PA causes a page fault. 

   The running process will proceed after the required data is loaded from
   virtual space to physical space.
