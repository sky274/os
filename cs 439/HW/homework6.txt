A page fault occurs when a program accesses a page that is mapped in the virtual address space but not loaded in physical memory. I/O interruption occurs. 

2.
This design wonâ€™t work well. This is ignoring the idea of memory being used as a cache. This does not use the ideas of temporal or spacial locality.

3.
A TLB is a small, virtually addressed cache where each line holds a block
consisting of a single PTE. A TLB usually has a high degree of associativity. 
It helps speed up address translation by eliminating the need for the MMU to refer to a PTE everytime it needs to translate the virtual address into a physical address

Advantages of small pages: 
Allows a process to run anywhere with fewer resources because more pages can be stored in a cache of the same size. Small pages can also retrieve small pieces of information from random locations much quicker.

Advantages of large pages: 
Allows a larger process to retrieve fewer large blocks more efficiently than many small ones. It also improves the number of index levels, and allows tables to include more columns

Bigger page: More locality, fewer page faults, PTs are smaller

1. 3 frames - 9  page faults
   4 frames - 10 page faults

2. LRU -     10 page faults with 3 frames
   Clock -   8 page faults
   Optimal - 7 page faults
Optimal algorithm results in the least number of page faults.
