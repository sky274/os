Updates to inodes will have to be done in all the copies. This will decrease the performance of operations that attempt to modify the inodes, such as allocating a new file, deleting a file, extending the size of a file. However, reading information from an inode can be made faster with clever disk scheduling.

The journaled file system (JFS) maintains a log, or journal, of what activity has taken place in the main data areas of the disk; if a crash occurs, any lost data can be recreated because updates to the metadata in directories and bit maps have been written to a log.

The trace starts in Austin on the UT servers and moves out to further servers.
I noticed that the traceroute puts 30 hops as max and only uses about 14 hops in order to finish the trace.

The routing seem to be faster when the tracer is run twice

a) {(2 * 200) + 10 + 20} + {(2 * 200) + 800 + 20} = 1650 microseconds
b) 1290 microseconds
c) 8182 microseconds
d) 8148 microseconds
